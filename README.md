## Description 

I created an interface that makes it easier for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in database. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. So I architect and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Technologies

<summary>Expand to see technologies used</summary>

## Javascript

### Node

I used node to initialize package.json. After the initialization, I added inquirer, mysql, lodash, console.table, chalk and figlet via NPM.  Also used node to make a connection with the data base.   

### NPM

I used npm to install the dependency express that did most of the heavy lifting for this application. I also installed uuid to help with creating ids. 

#### MYSQL

I use mysql to make a connections to the data base by running it through node. I made several queries to get specific data in each time.  In certain instance I used a for loop and others I used map to display data to the CLI. I also used console.table to display certain sets of data or the response.

#### Inquirer

I used inquirer for all the prompts to the user. I use several types of question to prompt users. I used input, list, and raw list to get number value.

#### Chalk, Figlet

I used these two dependencies to style the start of of the application

#### Console.table

The dependency displays object and other data sets in a cleaner form. I used it specifically for that purpose.
